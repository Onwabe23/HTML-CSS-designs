HTML and CSS Designs
This repository will have all the HTML and CSS designs, there won't be any JavaScript. Therefore these websites won't be interactive as the aim is to showcase my HTML and CSS skills
In these projects I will be create grid and flexbox layout and in some I will be showcasing how to desgin a website with a given griv or flexbox layout
Interactive websites will be found in my HTML CSS and JavaScript altogether repository and I am also planning to create a full stack application that will use Node Express and MongoDB
